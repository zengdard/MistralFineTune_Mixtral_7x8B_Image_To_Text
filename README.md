# MistralFineTune_Mixtral_7x8B_Image_To_Text

## Overview

This project showcases the integration of a fine-tuned Mixtral 7b model for chat completion with image retrieval based on text prompts. By providing an image prompt, the model generates a textual description of the image and converts it into ASCII art.

## Features

- Perform chat completion using a fine-tuned Mixtral 7b model.
- Retrieve and display ASCII art representations of images corresponding to specific text prompts from a dataset.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository.git
   cd your-repository
   ```
